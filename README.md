## Pyatlan experiments

```
To extend the SDK with custom typedefs:
eg: python3 class_generator.py --with-custom-typedefs
It will generate custom/model/assets/
```

**Note:** The current experimental stuff are manually extracted for understanding
the structure of custom model classes. To make it work, we need to update the code in `class_generator.py`.
